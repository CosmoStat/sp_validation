# workflow/ — shared analysis

The modular Snakemake workflow that produces every analysis product and
diagnostic plot. Generic and reusable: the rules live here once, organized for
several people to run them side by side without stepping on each other.

What belongs here:

- **Reusable rules and their scripts** — `Snakefile`, `rules/`, `scripts/`,
  and the shared helpers in `common.py`. Anything generic enough that a second
  run or a second person would want it.
- **Everything up to a paper figure's inputs.** The boundary is the inputs to a
  figure: catalogues, correlation functions, covariances, chains, and the
  diagnostic plots that vet them — all analysis, all here. Outputs go to the
  top-level `results/`, never alongside the rules.

What does *not* belong here:

- **Final-figure assembly** (PDF, colour, layout for one paper) lives in
  `papers/<paper>/`.
- **One-off, exploratory work** lives in `scratch/<you>/`; promote it here only
  once it is generic and worth sharing.

Runs stay modular, not monolithic: a paper or run composes these rules with
Snakemake's `module` directive under its own config and an output `prefix`, so
each namespaces cleanly under `results/<name>/`.

## Running on the cluster — the candide profile

`profiles/candide/config.yaml` is the committed SLURM profile: it hands
Snakemake the candide executor, account, partition, node excludes, and per-job
floor, so scheduling is repo state rather than an operator's shell. Drive any
target with one command:

```bash
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/candide \
    -s workflow/image_sims/Snakefile \
    <target> --configfile <run config>
```

For example, the image-sim m-bias chain end to end (`im_mbias` fans out one
SLURM job per branch × tile, MPI-free):

```bash
snakemake --profile workflow/profiles/candide \
    -s workflow/image_sims/Snakefile \
    im_mbias --configfile my_run.yaml
```

Give the target *before* `--configfile`: `--configfile` takes one-or-more
paths, so a target after it is read as a config file ("No such file:
im_mbias"). Always dry-run first with `-n`.

The profile carries only cluster policy — no container settings (the image-sims
rules own their `apptainer exec` call) and no `OMP_NUM_THREADS` (pinned to 1 at
that same `apptainer exec` line, since the slurm executor's `--export=ALL`
propagates the driver's env, not a profile flag). Per-rule `mem_mb` / `runtime`
stay on the rules. Off-cluster, drop `--profile` and add `-j N`. See the
profile's own comments for the full rationale.
